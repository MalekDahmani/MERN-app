            <h1 >Carbohydrates</h1>
            <p>Firstly, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body and therefore play the most substantial role in fueling exercise. There are two different types of carbohydrates i.e. complex and simple. The names give an indication of the time taken to digest complex carbs that take a longer time period to digest than simple carbs.

Furthermore, complex carbohydrates provide the body with prolonged slow-release of energy and have a great nutritional benefit. While simple carbohydrates provide the body with a short-term, fast releasing energy, they contain little nutritional value.

            <h1>Protein</h1>
            <p>Specifically, the majority of gym-goers will be well aware that consuming protein is important. Likewise, the reason why protein is so important is because it plays a key role in recovery and repair. A gym diet plan must include protein. During exercise, the body is exposed to strains and stresses. This cause damage to occur to the muscles at a microscopic level. So, in order to repair the damage, protein is needed. Without it, recovery periods will be extended and chronic fatigue may become a factor.

            <h1>Fats</h1>
           <p>Fats are often incorrectly seen as the primary reason for fat gain. However, fats are not responsible for this and actually play a key role in the absorption and transport of nutrients. In addition, they can have a positive impact on heart health and hormone production.</p>

            <h1>Magnesium</h1>
            <p>Magnesium is a chemical element that is necessary for muscle contractions while training, along with a whole host of other important biological functions. It’s found in green leafy vegetables, fruits such as figs and avocados, nuts, seeds, legumes, and seafood. It’s taken as a supplement due to its omission from the modern grain-rich diet. Magnesium is also lost through sweat, which is why it’s often taken as a supplement by athletes despite their otherwise balanced diets.</p>

            <h1>Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)</h1>
            <p>What are they?

There are three BCAAs: leucine, isoleucine and valine. These are amino-acids that make up around one third of muscle protein. They are especially important as the body is unable to make them out of other amino acids, meaning they must be ingested through food or supplements. They can be found in varying levels within protein rich foods, such as eggs, meat, nuts or legumes.

            <h1>Caffeine</h1>
            <p>What is it?

We’re sure you’re familiar with caffeine, especially in its most common form – coffee. It’s a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, and technically the world’s most widely consumed psychoactive drug.

What does it do?

Caffeine is increasingly becoming important as a nutritional supplement in the gym. It has been shown to stimulate the body into using fat cells for energy instead of other fuel sources – such as your muscle mass. It also raises your metabolism, which makes you burn more calories throughout the day, boosts pain tolerance, and helps you work out for longer periods.</p>
